## Circus Database 


In this project I've made a **Rest API** in Node.js, using Express as the application framework, leveraging a NoSQL database - MongoDB - as means of storing the data.
    Here you can create, read, update or delete data - CRUD. These functions give you the possibility to manage the data in the DataBase, which has all the information about, in this case in particular, a Circus :circus_tent:

<!-- In this REST API, information about a circus is managed, which employs several people, all of them with some particularities that make them unique and special.  -->
